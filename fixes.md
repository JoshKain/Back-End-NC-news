## Controllers

- no nested thens! In order to async code more readable promises allow us to return promises from the callbacks and access the result in the next `then` block. Use this style

##still to do

```http
GET /api/articles
    <!-- - add a `total_count` property, displaying the total number of articles (**this should display the total number of articles with any filters applied, discounting the limit**)

 DELETE /api/articles/:article_id use cascades on migration if it references something but can use on delete/on null or cascades
```
